# Future of Static Site Generation in NextJS 

## Static Site Generation
NextJS automatically generates the static html pages for you if your pages have no data fetching requirements. 


## Combining SSG and Client side requests
You can combine SSG with the client-side data requirements. This helps the first page load to show the static content faster, but also loads the 
dynamic content from the client side.


## Demo
- `yarn install & yarn next`
